Moving away from the functions contained in the Prelude is a matter
of course. So everyone (or at least every project) writes their own
custom Prelude eventually. This is my attempt.

Likely to both grow and shrink as I use Haskell more and figure
out which parts I like and don't like, which parts are practical
and which parts aren't. So don't rely too heavily on this having
a consistent interface.

At the very least, breaking interface changes will only happen on
full version number changes. Additions to the interface can happen
whenever.
